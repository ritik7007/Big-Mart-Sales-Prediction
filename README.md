Technical Approach
Data Preprocessing
1.	Missing Value Imputation:
o	Item_Weight: Item-specific mean imputation
o	Outlet_Size: Mode based on Outlet_Type
2.	Data Quality Fixes:
o	Standardized Item_Fat_Content values
o	Replaced zero visibility with item-specific means
3.	Feature Engineering:
o	Created 8+ new features based on domain knowledge
o	Applied categorical encoding strategies
Model Development
1.	Baseline Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
2.	Tree-based Models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Trees
3.	Gradient Boosting: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting
4.	Ensemble: Weighted average of top-performing models
Performance Optimization
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: 50+ iterations for best models
•	Cross-Validation: Robust performance estimation
•	Ensemble Weighting: Performance-based model combination
Expected Results
Model Performance Targets
•	Baseline RMSE: ~1150-1200
•	Advanced Models: ~1050-1100
•	Final Ensemble: ~1040-1080
Key Performance Features
•	Feature Importance: MRP, Outlet_Type, and Item_Type as top predictors
•	Model Robustness: Consistent performance across CV folds
•	Generalization: Strong validation performance indicates good generalization
Key Innovations
1. Advanced Feature Engineering
# Examples of engineered features
combined['Outlet_Years'] = 2013 - combined['Outlet_Establishment_Year']
combined['Price_per_Weight'] = combined['Item_MRP'] / combined['Item_Weight']
combined['Visibility_Ratio'] = item_visibility / category_mean_visibility

2. Intelligent Missing Value Handling
# Item-specific weight imputation
item_weight_mean = combined.groupby('Item_Identifier')['Item_Weight'].mean()
combined['Item_Weight'] = combined.apply(
    lambda x: item_weight_mean[x['Item_Identifier']] 
    if pd.isna(x['Item_Weight']) else x['Item_Weight'], axis=1
)

3. Performance-Weighted Ensemble
# Dynamic ensemble weights based on validation performance
total_weight = 1/xgb_rmse + 1/lgb_rmse + 1/rf_rmse
xgb_weight = (1/xgb_rmse) / total_weight
ensemble_pred = (xgb_weight * xgb_pred + lgb_weight * lgb_pred + rf_weight * rf_pred)

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1.	File Not Found Error:
Ensure train.csv and test.csv are in the main directory

2.	Memory Issues:
# Reduce model complexity or use subsampling
model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=100)  # Instead of 500

3.	Slow Performance:
# Reduce hyperparameter search space
param_grid = {'n_estimators': [100, 200]}  # Instead of [100, 200, 300, 500]

Performance Metrics
Expected leaderboard position: Top 10% based on:
•	Advanced feature engineering
•	Comprehensive model experimentation
•	Robust ensemble approach
•	Domain expertise application
